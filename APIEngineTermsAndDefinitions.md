# API Set

The API Set is a Record that represents a collection of API Functions and one or more [API Credentials](#def-api-credential). The API Set allows for some referential information about the collection. Most often, the API Set is used to contain many API end points that work together for a functional platform. Example: The Shopify Admin API.
