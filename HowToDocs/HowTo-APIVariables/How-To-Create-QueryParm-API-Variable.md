# How to Create a URL Query Parm with an API Variable

This Section will describe how to add simple query parm to a URL in an API Function.  To achieve this, we can add an API Variable to the API Function we are constructing.  API Variables define how the request will be built for the API Function.  Different types of API Variables are used to build differnt parts of the request (URL, URL Path, URL Parameter, Header, Body).  In this case, we will add an API Variable of type URL Parameter to add a Query Parm to our URL.
